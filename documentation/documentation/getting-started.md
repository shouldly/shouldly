# Getting Started

Here are some guides to setup a Shouldly project.


## Setup a project with Dotnet CLI

In this guide, we will set up a project with Shouldly unit tests.

We won't use Visual Studio, we will build our project bare bones with Dotnet CLI and a text editor.


## Prerequisites

 * Install [Dotnet CLI Tools](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/install).
 * You need to install a text editor (Notepad++, VSCode, etc...).


## Creating the main program

The project structure will be as follows:

```csharp
/project-name
    project-name.sln
    /program
        ...
    /test
```

 1. Create your root directory, name it your project name.
 1. Open a terminal in your root directory.
 1. Run `dotnet new sln`.
 1. Go into program folder and run `dotnet new classlib`.
 1. Rename *Class1.cs* to *Program.cs*.
 1. Add the following code to *Program.cs*:

```csharp
using System;

namespace project_name
{
    public static class Program
    {
        public static string testWorks()
        {
            return "Works";
        }
    }
}
```

Go to the root folder and run `dotnet sln add program/program.csproj`, in order to add *program* to your solution.


## Creating unit tests


In this part we will create the unit tests for the main program.

 1. Move to test folder and run `dotnet new nunit` *(you can use others unit tests frameworks but in this guide we will stick to nunit)*.
 1. Add a reference to the main program by running `dotnet add reference ../program/program.csproj`
 1. In the root folder add the tests to the solution by running `dotnet sln add test/test.csproj`.


## Adding Shouldly

Now comes the important part, when we actually add Shouldly.

#. Go to the test folder and run `dotnet add package Shouldly`, to add Shouldly as a NuGet Package.
#. Add the following code to *UnitTest1.cs*:

```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;
using project_name;
using Shouldly;

namespace Tests
{
    public class Tests
    {

        [Test]
        public void Test1()
        {
            Program.testWorks().ShouldBe("Works");
        }
    }
}
```


## Testing

To test your project, in your root folder run `dotnet test`.

And there you go, you have a basic project with unit tests using Shouldly.


## Summary

We created a classlib project using Dotnet CLI Tools,
then added unit tests and added Shouldly as a NuGet package to be able to use Shouldly in our tests.
