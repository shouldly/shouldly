NAnt

What is it? 
-----------
NAnt is a .NET based build tool. In theory it is kind of like make without 
make's wrinkles. In practice it's a lot like Ant. 
  
If you are not familiar with Jakarta Ant you can get more information at the
Ant project web site (http://ant.apache.org/).


Why NAnt?
---------
Because Ant was too Java specific.
Because Ant needed the Java runtime.  NAnt only needs the .NET 
or Mono runtime.


The Latest Version
------------------
Details of the latest version can be found on the NAnt project web site

Compilation and Installation
----------------------------

   a. Overview
   -----------
   The compilation process uses NAnt to build NAnt.
   
   The approach is to first compile a copy of NAnt (using make/nmake) for 
   bootstrapping purpose. Next, the bootstrapped version of NAnt is used in 
   conjunction with NAnt build file (NAnt.build) to build the full version.
   
   
   b. Prerequisites
   ----------------
   To build NAnt, you will need the following components:

   Windows
   -------

       * A version of the Microsoft .NET Framework

           Available from http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/
         
           You will need the .NET Framework SDK as well as the runtime 
           components if you intend to compile programs.

           Note: NAnt currently supports versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.5, and 4.0 
           of the Microsoft .NET Framework. 

       or

       * Mono for Windows (version 2.0 or higher)

           Available from http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/
   
   Linux/Unix
   ----------

       * GNU toolchain - including GNU make

       * pkg-config

           Available from: http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/pkgconfig

       * A working Mono installation and development libraries (version 2.0 or higher)

           Available from: http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/

           
    b. Building the Software
    ------------------------
      
    Build NAnt using Microsoft .NET:     

    GNU Make
    --------
        make install MONO= MCS=csc prefix=<installation path> [DESTDIR=<staging path>] [TARGET=<nant target>]

        eg. make install MONO= MCS=csc prefix="c:\Program Files" TARGET=net-2.0

    NMake
    -----
        nmake -f Makefile.nmake install prefix=<installation path> [DESTDIR=<staging path>] [TARGET=<nant target>]
    
        eg. nmake -f Makefile.nmake install prefix="c:\Program Files" TARGET=net-4.0


    Building NAnt using Mono:

    GNU Make
    --------
        make install prefix=<installation path> [DESTDIR=<staging path>] [TARGET=<nant target>]

        eg. make install prefix="c:\Program Files" TARGET=mono-4.0

    NMake
    -----
        nmake -f Makefile.nmake install MONO=mono CSC=mcs prefix=<installation path> [DESTDIR=<staging path>] [TARGET=<nant target>]
    
        eg. nmake -f Makefile.nmake install MONO=mono CSC=mcs prefix=/usr/local/

These instructions only apply to the source distribution of NAnt, as the binary distribution 
contains pre-built assemblies.
