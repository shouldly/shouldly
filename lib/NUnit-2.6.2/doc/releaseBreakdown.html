<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>Tests may now be loaded and run from a shared directory specified as a UNC path.
<li>Tests may now be run under .NET 4.5.
<li>When running under a debugger, any nunit-agent process launched will break and allow the option to continue debugging the agent process as well.
<li>J# and old-style managed C++ samples have been removed. F# samples are now included. Code samples are no longer included in the standard installs but are available as a separate download. All samples now use VS2010 projects.
</ul>

</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>
<ul>
<li>When running under .NET 4.5, <b>async</b> test methods are now supported. For test cases returning a value, the method must return <b>Task&lt;T&gt;</b>, where <b>T</b> is the type of the returned value.

</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>The API used to create <b>Action Attributes</b> has been changed from the

<h3>NUnit 2.6 Beta 4 - Version 2.6.0.12017 - January 17, 2012</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit no longer stores settings in the test configuration file, as it
    did in earlier versions. Specifically, we no longer recognize or support 
    OldStyleTestCases, ApartmentState, ThreadPriority or DefaultLogThreshold 
    in the configuration file. Further details on each of these features are 
    included in the appropriate sections below.
<li>The TestRunner interface has been modified. Applications using this
    interface will need to be modified but general users are not effected.
<li>The build now uses the NAnt 0.91 final release.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>User-defined equality comparers specified with the <b>Using</b> syntax 
    element may now be used with arrays and dictionaries. Essentially, this 
    means that there are no longer any restrictions on the Types for which a 
    user-defined equality comparer may be specified.
<li>So-called "old-style" tests, identified by having a name beginning with
    "Test" are no longer supported in NUnit 2.6.
<li>Setting a ThreadPriority for the test runner thread is no longer supported
    under NUnit 2.6.
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>
<ul>
<li>The following new command-line options are provided:
  <ul>
    <li><b>-stoponerror</b> causes execution of the test run to terminate 
        immediately on the first test failure or error.
    <li><b>-apartment</b> is used to specify the ApartmentState (STA or MTA)
        of the test runner thread. Since the default is MTA, the option is
        only needed to force execution in the Single Threaded Apartment.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>A number of new settings are available using the <b>Settings Dialog</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>The <b>Tree Display</b> page allows the user to select alternate image sets for 
      use in the test tree. Additional user-provided image sets may be added if desired.
  <li>The <b>Text Output</b> page allows setting the threshold for capture and display 
      of log4net output (previously controlled by the test config file).
  </ul>
<li>By default, test Cases under a Theory that fail an assumption are no longer shown in the tree.
    A context menu item has been added to allow the user to view them.
<li>The properties dialog has been redesigned to be more compact and readable.
<li>The context menu for the test tree has been simplified.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>605034 	Log4net not working with NUnit
<li>708173 	NUnit's logic for comparing arrays - use Comparer&lt;T[]&gt; if it is provided
<li>719184 	Platformdependency in src/ClientUtilities/util/Services/DomainManager.cs:40
<li>761579 	Tests using log4net run very slowly
<li>848713 	Feature request: Add switch for console to break on any test case error
<li>882192 	Ignored test icon should be more prominent
<li>885173 	Tests are still executed after cancellation by user
<li>896615 	Tests can't be run in existing AppDomain
<li>897289 	Is.Empty constraint has unclear failure message
<li>899178 	Wrong failure message for parameterized tests that expect exceptions
<li>902305 	Gui should not normally display Inconclusive test cases for a Theory
<li>902343 	Gui 'Hide Tests' function no longer works
<li>903078 	DomainUsage.None setting crashes nunit-gui
<li>903080 	Test tree context menu needs to be simplified
<li>904841 	After exiting for timeout the teardown method is not executed
<li>907270 	Gui enables run when the assembly specified on the command line is not found
<li>908829 	TestCase attribute does not play well with variadic test functions
<li>910218 	NUnit should add a trailing separator to the ApplicationBase
<li>912955 	Project files missing in source code package
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.6 Beta 3 - Version 2.6.0.11340 - December 6, 2011</h3>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Constraint syntax now supports <b>Is.Positive</b>, which is interpreted
as greater than zero, and <b>Is.Negative</b>, which is interpreted as less than zero.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>892844 	Not using Mono 4.0 profile under Windows
<li>892845 	"Mono" is not clearly shown in About box or Test Assemblies dialog
<li>892847 	Gui offers to load assemblies under a lower CLR version
<li>893919 	DelayedConstraint fails polling properties on references which are initially null
<li>893991 	When working directory contains # sign, it is truncated
<li>898192 	Feature Request: Is.Negative, Is.Positive
<li>898256 	IEnumerable<T> for Datapoints doesn't work
<li>898850 	NUnit 2.6 beta 2 crashes on assemblies without tests
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.6 Beta 2 - Version 2.6.0.11324 - November 20, 2011</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit's executables now use config files that allow smoother running 
    of mixed assemblies built for .NET 2.0 under .NET 4.0.
<li>When opening Visual Studio formatted solutions, NUnit now uses the
    solution configuration by default, resulting in changed behavior from
    previous releases. The Settings Dialog may be used to revert NUnit to
    the earlier behavior, which ignored solution configurations.
<li>Changing the URL to be used for NUnit help through the config file
    is no longer supported.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>TestCaseAttribute</b> now accepts <b>Explicit</b> and <b>Reason</b> 
    named parameters.
<li><b>TestCaseSourceAttribute</b> now accepts a <b>Category</b> named parameter.
<li><b>TestCaseData</b> now supports marking individual test cases as <b>Explicit</b>.
<li><b>EqualConstraint</b> now recognizes and uses <b>IEquatable&lt;T&gt;</b> if
    it is implemented on either the actual or the expected value. The interface
    is used in preference to any override of <b>Object.Equals()</b>, so long as
    the other argument is of Type T. Note that this applies to all equality tests 
    performed by NUnit.
<li>When <b>Assert.Throws()</b> fails due to an exception of the wrong Type being
    thrown, the error message now includes the Message and Stack Trace from the
    exception.
<li>The constraint syntax now supports <b>Has.Exactly(n)...</b> in place of 
    <b>Has.Some...</b> in order to allow tests over collections that must
    be satisfied a specific number of times.
<li>The <b>Using(...)</b> syntactic element may now be repeated multiple
    times in an expression, so long as each comparer applies to a different
    Type. NUnit will use the appropriate comparer, depending on the Type
    of the arguments. Among other things, this allows overriding the default
    NUnit comparison of collections.
<li>Documentation is provided for the previously undocumented <b>TestContext</b>. 
    A new property <b>TestContext.WorkDirectory</b> allows tests to access the
    name of a directory to be used for file output. This directory may be 
    specified by use of the <b>/work</b> option of <b>nunit-console</b>.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The test reload functionality in the Gui has been rewritten and simplified so that
    the same logic is used for all cases where the visual state of the tree is to be
    recovered. Test results are now found even if changes to the assembly have resulted
    in the assignment of new ids to the tests.
<li>The Gui now displays invalid tests in red immediately upon load, without waiting 
    for the user to run them. Tests marked with the <b>IgnoreAttribute</b> are displayed
    in yellow immediately as well.
<li>The directory containing the log files may be opened directly from the Gui by
    use of a new item on the <b>Tools</b> menu.
<li>Test summary results are truncated when the window size is too small. The full
    summary is displayed when hovering over the field.
<li>A number of new settings are available using the <b>Settings Dialog</b>:
  <ul>
  <li>The <b>Project Editor</b> page allows the user to select whether the NUnit 
      <b>Project Editor</b> or another external program will be used when editing
      the settings file.
  <li>The <b>Runtime Selection</b> page allows enabling or disabling automatic
      detection of the target runtime for each test assembly.
  <li>The <b>Advanced Loader Settings</b> page now allows specifying the argument to use
      in calling SetPrincipalPolicy for each test AppDomain.
  <li>The <b>Visual Studio</b> page now includes a setting that enables or disables
      the use of solution configs when loading Visual Studio solution files.
  <li>The <b>Internal Trace</b> page now shows the directory path to which log files
      will be saved.
  </ul>
<li>The location of the settings dialog under the Windows AppData directory has been 
    changed from Roaming to Local. Users will need to reset their preferences in some cases.
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.6 Beta 1 - Version 2.6.0.11240 - August 28, 2011</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit is now built using .NET 3.5. All NUnit assemblies and most tests
    target .NET 2.0 but the full set of tests requires 3.5 to execute.
<li>The build script now supports building from source under .NET 4.0.
    The script selects either .NET 3.5 or .NET 4.0 to perform the build,
    depending on what is available.
<li>NAnt 0.91 alpha2 release is now used for building on Windows. The 0.90
    release is still used on Linux.
<li>Support for .NET 1.0 / 1.1 is no longer included in the main distribution
    for NUnit but is provided as a separate package.
<li>NUnit Mocks is now deprecated. All classes are now marked as obsolete.
<li>NUnit now uses the NSubstitute mock framework its own tests. A copy of the 
    NSubstitute dll is included in the distribution.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit now supports composable <b>Action Attributes</b>, which allow the 
    test developer to put reusable test actions into attributes and attach 
    these actions to suites, tests, and test cases. The actions can run 
    arbitrary code before and after suites, tests, and test cases execute. 
    It enables the test developer to build smaller reusable actions and to 
    compose them in unique ways for each suite, test, or test case.
    <p><p><b>Note:</b> This feature is experimental and details are likely
    to change in the final release.
<li><b>PlatformAttribute</b> accepts "Net-3.0", "Net-3.5", "Mono-3.0" and "Mono-3.5" as arguments. Since these frameworks all
    use the 2.0 runtime, the semantics of their use is slightly different
    from other key words. The "3.5" arguments also include "3.0" and "2.0"
    and the "3.0" arguments include "2.0" in their interpretation.
<li><b>TestFixtureAttribute</b> now accepts a <b>Category</b> named parameter,
    allowing individual fixture instances to be included in or excluded from
    a test run.
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>

<ul>
<li>The .NET 1.1 build of nunit-console no longer supports the <b>-process</b>
    or <b>-framework</b> option. There is no automatic runtime detection and
    tests execute under same runtime as the console runner itself. If this
    functionality is needed when running tests under .NET 1.1, use the standard 
    console runner to execute the tests in a separate process.
<li>The following new command-line options are provided:
  <ul>
  <li><b>-result</b> is a synonym for <b>-xml</b>, specifying the file to be used for output of the test results in XML form. The <b>-xml</b> option is still recognized but will be removed in a future release.
  <li><b>-noresult</b> allows supressing the xml result output entirely.
  <li><b>-work</b> is used to specify the directory to be used for output files. Any relative paths specified with the <b>-output</b>, <b>-err</b> or <b>-result</b> options are resolved using this directory as a base.
  <li><b>-runlist</b> allows the user to specify a file that contains the names of the tests to be executed rather than listing them directly on the command line.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The <b>Project Editor</b> is now a separate program, which may be executed directly 
    or run through the Project | Edit dropdown menu of the NUnit GUI. The editor 
    now provides two main views of the project: a property-oriented view based 
    on the Project Editor that was built into earlier versions of the NUnit GUI 
    and an xml view, which allows simple editing of the .nunit file.
</ul>

<h4>PNUnit</h4>

<ul>
<li>The <b>PNUnit</b> code has been updated using the latest build from the developers
    at Codice Software and additional examples are provided in the source.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>691129 	Add Category parameter to TestFixture
<li>692180 	Script should allow building for net-2.0 under 3.5 or 4.0
<li>701331 	TestFixture attributes on base classes are not ignored
