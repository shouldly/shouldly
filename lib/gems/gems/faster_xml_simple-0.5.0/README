FasterXmlSimple

FasterXS is intended to be a drop in replacement for the xml input functionality
from XmlSimple.  Instead of using rexml, it uses libxml and the associated ruby
bindings.  This reduces CPU utilisation and memory consumption considerably.

Preliminary benchmarks show it between 3 and 10 times as fast, and using a
fraction of the ram.
